# Vocab Importer

## Overview
We need to quickly populate the application with word and word groups so students can begin testing the system. We will use an LLM to generate words based on a prompt and then save the words to JSON. The JSON can then be imported into the application.

## Requirements
- The word must have the Jawi transcription
- The word must have the English translation
- The word must have a word group (food, color, etc)
- For fast prototyping, we will use Streamlit
- We will use Ollama served by Docker


### Technical Uncertainty
- The Jawi script generated by the LLM are often incorrect except for llama3-8b
- The model llama3-8b is quite slow running on a local machine. For now, we are not planning to run this model on the cloud due to budget constraints
- There are no available APIs to trascribe a Malay word into its Jawi script
- A Jawi-transcriptor is a future work in planning that is similar to sentence-constructor to solve the issue of incorrect Jawi script

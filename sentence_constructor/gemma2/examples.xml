    - BAD: in the vocabulary table, it left out most of the words from the query
    - GOOD: it is challenging the student to reform their thought process in order to work within the constraints
    - BAD: it does not provide enough clues

    That's a good challenge!  Toki Pona has some limitations when dealing with specific animals and complex actions like "leaving something out." Let's break it down:

**Vocabulary Table Reminder:**


| English          | Toki Pona                  | Limitation                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|
| bears           |  _ala pini e mute a moku_ |  No specific word for "bear" - uses descriptive terms.|


**Clues and Considerations**

1. **Describing Bears:** How can we describe a bear using Toki Pona's vocabulary? Think about size, fur color, and typical animal sounds.
2. **"At the door":**  Toki Pona doesn't have a specific word for "door." What words could we use to convey location near an entrance?
3. **"Leave the garbage out":** Toki Pona lacks precise words for actions like "leave" or "garbage." We'll need to be creative and describe what happened.

Think about these things, and don't hesitate to ask if you need more clues!





>>> soweli suli li lon lupa. sina weka e jaki la?
That's a clever attempt! You're thinking creatively with the words you have. Let's break down your sentence:

* **"soweli suli li lon lupa"**:  You've used "soweli" which means "animal," and "suli" is close to "big."   "Lon lupa" could mean something like "near the food place."


**Here's how we can refine it:**

1. **Focus on the Animal:** Instead of "suli," consider words that better describe a bear, like "pini e mute" (big and dark) or "moku" (strong).
2. **Location:**  "Lupa" usually means "food." Think about how to express being "at the door" in Toki Pona without a direct word for "door."

**Let's try this revised version:**

"Pini e mute lon oken mi, sina weka e jaki la?"

This translates roughly to:  "Big and dark animal near my house, did you put out the food?"




 Keep practicing! You're getting closer to expressing those complex ideas in Toki Pona.

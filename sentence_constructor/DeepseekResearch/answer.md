## Sentence Structure

In Malay, questions can be formed in several ways. For your first sentence, you can use:

1. Question word formation: "Adakah" + subject + verb + object
    - Example structure: "Adakah kamu lihat burung gagak pagi ini?"

For the second sentence expressing past continuous:
2. Subject + "sedang" + verb + object

- Example structure: "Mereka sedang melihat taman kita."

In Malay, the past continuous tense uses "sedang" before the verb without changing the verb form[^6]. This is different from English where we use "was/were" + verb+ing.

## Clues and Considerations

1. **Forming the question**: Malay questions often use "adakah" at the beginning or the suffix "-kah" attached to the first word[^1][^7]. Look at the vocabulary table for "did you see."
2. **Time expression**: In Malay, "this morning" (pagi ini) typically comes at the end of the question.
3. **Past continuous**: To express "they were looking," use "sedang" before the verb "melihat"[^3][^6]. Unlike English, Malay doesn't change the verb form for tense.
4. **Word order**: Malay generally follows Subject-Verb-Object order, similar to English.
5. **Connecting the sentences**: You might want to combine these sentences with "dan" (and) or keep them separate as in English.

Try constructing your sentence using these clues! Remember that learning a new language takes practice, so don't worry if it takes a few attempts to get it right. I'm here to help guide you through the process.

## Language Restristions
Toki Pona has several intentional restrictions that make it a minimalist language. Here are the main ones:

### 1. **Limited Vocabulary**  
   - Toki Pona has only **around 120–137 words**, depending on the version.  
   - Each word has **broad meanings**, requiring heavy reliance on context.

### 2. **Simple Grammar**  
   - No **plural forms** (e.g., _jan_ can mean “person” or “people”).  
   - No **tenses** (context or time words like _tenpo pini_ “past” clarify).  
   - No **gender-specific words** (e.g., _mama_ means both “mother” and “father”).  
   - No **case marking** (e.g., no distinction between “I” and “me”).  

### 3. **No Complex Sentences**  
   - No relative clauses (instead, separate sentences are used).  
   - No conjunctions like “and” or “but” (rewording is needed).  

### 4. **No Exact Numbers**  
   - Only _wan_ (one), _tu_ (two), and _mute_ (many) exist.  
   - Some speakers use _ala_ (zero) and _luka_ (five), but there’s no standard large-number system.  

### 5. **Phonetic Simplicity**  
   - Only **14 phonemes** (9 consonants, 5 vowels).  
   - No consonant clusters (e.g., no “str” or “bl” sounds).  
   - Syllable structure is always CV (consonant-vowel) or V.  

### 6. **No Loanwords**  
   - Foreign names and concepts must be **rephrased or adapted** (e.g., "Malaysia" → _ma Malesi_).  

These restrictions make Toki Pona efficient but also require creativity to express complex ideas!

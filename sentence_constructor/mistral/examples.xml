- To express that bears are at the door, use wileke (exist or be) along with mute tun liwa and wan lon (one door).
- When asking if you left something out, we can combine "leave" (toki) with "one waste" (wan sina) and "outside of one door" (wan lon mute kama). Keep in mind that the
interpretation relies heavily on context.
- Remember that Toki Pona requires creativity and heavy reliance on context to express complex ideas efficiently!
